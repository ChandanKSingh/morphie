logle is a tool for summarizing activity in Plaso logs. For example, it will
take a log file and conclude that an FTP session was used to download a Windows
executable, and this executable was run on a text file downloaded using FireFox.

Status: early stage of development.

About the name:
logle is a portmanteau of log and ogle.  The intended pronunciation is as a
rhyme of 'ogle'. Eg: "let's logle long logs."
