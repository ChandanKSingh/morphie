Logle is a tool for using graphs to analyze and summarize the content of
formatted logs. The primary use case is to analyze supertimelines generated by
Plaso, which is an open source, forensic analysis tool
(https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso). Logle currently parses supertimelines
and constructs labeled graphs from them. There is support for visualization
using GraphViz.

Logle is not an official Google product.

Development is at an early stage.

About the name:
logle is a portmanteau of log and ogle.  The intended pronunciation is as a
rhyme of 'ogle'. Eg: "let's logle long logs."


To install run the following commands:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..

The project uses the following libraries:
 - The Boost graph and string libraries.
 - The Boost regular expression library.
 - The Jsoncpp library for parsing JSON.
 - The Google Test libraries.
