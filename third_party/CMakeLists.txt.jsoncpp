# The ExternalProject CMake module provides functionality for
# downloading and installing a library from a remote repository. In
# this case, branch tagged 'master' from the jsoncpp GitHub
# repository is downloaded. The ExternalProject_Add module also uses a
# variable called INSTALL_DIR but setting this directory is not
# sufficient to ensure that the libraries are installed in the desired
# location because it does not cause the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable
# to be set.
